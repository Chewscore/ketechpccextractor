KeTech PCC Smart Extractor

This is an extractor written to extract files from KeTech PCC file type announcement packs, which can be obtained through FOI requests to public body rail operators. Some older models of their products store the announcements on a .PCC file type which has been impossible to extract without a piece of hardware until now.

Just select the .PCC file type you are trying to extract and voila! Bob's your uncle and you'll have access to whatever you like that was compressed into that .PCC file type.
